We build open trust protocols for the machine-readable web.

### ✨ What we maintain:
- [LLMFeed](https://wellknownmcp.org/spec/llmfeed) — the context capsule format for LLMs
- [MCP](https://wellknownmcp.org/spec/mcp) — Machine Connectable Protocol (signed endpoints for actions)
- [LLMCA](https://llmca.org) — trust layer for verified context, agent-safe capabilities, and real-time auditing

### 🔐 What we believe:
- Trust doesn’t require obfuscation — it requires verification.
- The future of the web is interpretable, not just visual.
- Every domain can speak to an LLM — if it knows how to describe itself clearly.
